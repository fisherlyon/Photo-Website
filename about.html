                <p>Hi, my name is Fisher Lyon.</p>
                <p>My interest in photography started during the summer of 2024 when I encountered a fully mechanical film camera for the first time, the Nikon F. I was amazed by the fact that this little box of metal could capture images without any electricity. Though I'd had an interest in photography in the past, this moment launched me down the photography rabbit hole.</p>
                <p>A couple months after that moment, I bought my very first pair of film cameras, a Minolta SR-1 and a Minolta SRT-101, and I started shooting with film on the regular. After shooting with those for a while, I decided to move into mdeium format film and I got myself a Yashica-D TLR.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, I have too many film cameras and I also started shooting digitally with a FujiFilm XE-1. I opted for this camera over other digital options because it allowed for an affordable entry into the medium and it allowed for me to easily adapt my manual film lenses to the camera's body.</p>
                <p>Since I am new to this photography thing, I am still in search of my photographical tendencies and keys. I tend to just capture subjects that I find interesting, and I am having fun doing it.</p>
